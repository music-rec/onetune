# onetune.fm

This is the source code powering onetune.fm, a web music streaming service that I wrote in 2013 when I was 17. I don't develop this service any further, but I'm making the code available for the public as a portfolio project.

This project was created in a time where the current Node.js version was 0.10 and it is super primitive, because I had never taken a programming course or cared about best practices.

There is no Babel, no Webpack, no promises, no tests, no linting. The whole frontend is written in jQuery, nonetheless you will find a surprising amount of features

## Features

- Search over 5 million tracks through iTunes
- Listen to them through automatic YouTube matching
- Build your library mixing iTunes and YouTube music
- Search artists, tracks and YouTube videos simultaneously
- Playlists
    - Support for display order, filtering, renaming, reordering
	- Share your playlists, follow other people's playlists
	- Drag and drop, context menus
	- Playlist header color matches album art
- Artist, Album and song pages
- Lyrics (broken in 2018)
- Time machine - retro charts by up to 1959
- iTunes charts
- Half-baked emote control feature onetune.fm/remote
